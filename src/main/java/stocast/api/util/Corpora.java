                "onyx-paved bathroom. The cool water refreshed him after his long sleep.\n" +

                "table close to the open window. It was an exquisite day. The warm air\n" +

                "his own imagination that had made him see a look of evil where there had\n" +
                "been a look of joy? Surely a painted canvas could not alter? The thing\n" +
                "was absurd. It would serve as a tale to tell Basil some day. It would\n" +
                "make him smile.\n" +

                "And, yet, how vivid was his recollection of the whole thing! First in\n" +
                "the dim twilight, and then in the bright dawn, he had seen the touch of\n" +
                "cruelty round the warped lips. He almost dreaded his valet leaving the\n" +
                "room. He knew that when he was alone he would have to examine the\n" +
                "portrait. He was afraid of certainty. When the coffee and cigarettes\n" +
                "had been brought and the man turned to go, he felt a wild desire to tell\n" +
                "him to remain. As the door was closing behind him he called him back.\n" +
                "The man stood waiting for his orders. Dorian looked at him for a moment.\n" +
                "\"I am not at home to anyone, Victor,\" he said, with a sigh. The man\n" +
                "bowed and retired.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Then he rose from the table, lit a cigarette, and flung himself down on\n" +
                "a luxuriously-cushioned couch that stood facing the screen. The screen\n" +
                "was an old one, of gilt Spanish leather, stamped and wrought with a\n" +
                "rather florid Louis-Quatorze pattern. He scanned it curiously, wondering\n" +
                "if ever before it had concealed the secret of a man's life.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Should he move it aside, after all? Why not let it stay there? What was\n" +
                "the use of knowing? If the thing was true, it was terrible. If it was\n" +
                "not true, why trouble about it? But what if, by some fate or deadlier\n" +
                "chance, eyes other than his spied behind, and saw the horrible change?\n" +
                "What should he do if Basil Hallward came and asked to look at his own\n" +
                "picture? Basil would be sure to do that. No; the thing had to be\n" +
                "examined, and at once. Anything would be better than this dreadful state\n" +
                "of doubt.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "He got up, and locked both doors. At least he would be alone when he\n" +
                "looked upon the mask of his shame. Then he drew the screen aside, and\n" +
                "saw himself face to face. It was perfectly true. The portrait had\n" +
                "altered.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "As he often remembered afterwards, and always with no small wonder, he\n" +
                "found himself at first gazing at the portrait with a feeling of almost\n" +
                "scientific interest. That such a change should have taken place was\n" +
                "incredible to him. And yet it was a fact. Was there some subtle affinity\n" +
                "between the chemical atoms, that shaped themselves into form and colour\n" +
                "on the canvas, and the soul that was within him? Could it be that what\n" +
                "that soul thought, they realized?--that what it dreamed, they made true?\n" +
                "Or was there some other, more terrible reason? He shuddered, and felt\n" +
                "afraid, and, going back to the couch, lay there, gazing at the picture\n" +
                "in sickened horror.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "One thing, however, he felt that it had done for him. It had made him\n" +
                "conscious how unjust, how cruel, he had been to Sibyl Vane. It was not\n" +
                "too late to make reparation for that. She could still be his wife. His\n" +
                "unreal and selfish love would yield to some higher influence, would be\n" +
                "transformed into some nobler passion, and the portrait that Basil\n" +
                "Hallward had painted of him would be a guide to him through life, would\n" +
                "be to him what holiness is to some, and conscience to others, and the\n" +
                "fear of God to us all. There were opiates for remorse, drugs that could\n" +
                "lull the moral sense to sleep. But here was a visible symbol of the\n" +
                "degradation of sin. Here was an ever-present sign of the ruin men\n" +
                "brought upon their souls.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Three o'clock struck, and four, and the half-hour rang its double chime,\n" +
                "but Dorian Gray did not stir. He was trying to gather up the scarlet\n" +
                "threads of life, and to weave them into a pattern; to find his way\n" +
                "through the sanguine labyrinth of passion through which he was\n" +
                "wandering. He did not know what to do, or what to think. Finally, he\n" +
                "went over to the table, and wrote a passionate letter to the girl he had\n" +
                "loved, imploring her forgiveness, and accusing himself of madness. He\n" +
                "covered page after page with wild words of sorrow, and wilder words of\n" +
                "pain. There is a luxury in self-reproach. When we blame ourselves we\n" +
                "feel that no one else has a right to blame us. It is the confession, not\n" +
                "the priest, that gives us absolution. When Dorian had finished the\n" +
                "letter, he felt that he had been forgiven.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Suddenly there came a knock to the door, and he heard Lord Henry's voice\n" +
                "outside. \"My dear boy, I must see you. Let me in at once. I can't bear\n" +
                "your shutting yourself up like this.\"\n" +
                "\n" +
                "He made no answer at first, but remained quite still. The knocking\n" +
                "still continued, and grew louder. Yes, it was better to let Lord Henry\n" +
                "in, and to explain to him the new life he was going to lead, to quarrel\n" +
                "with him if it became necessary to quarrel, to part if parting was\n" +
                "inevitable. He jumped up, drew the screen hastily across the picture,\n" +
                "and unlocked the door.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"I am so sorry for it all, Dorian,\" said Lord Henry, as he entered. \"But\n" +
                "you must not think too much about it.\"\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"Do you mean about Sibyl Vane?\" asked the lad.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"Yes, of course,\" answered Lord Henry, sinking into a chair, and slowly\n" +
                "pulling off his yellow gloves. \"It is dreadful, from one point of view,\n" +
                "but it was not your fault. Tell me, did you go behind and see her, after\n" +
                "the play was over?\"\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"Yes.\"\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"I felt sure you had. Did you make a scene with her?\"\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"I was brutal, Harry--perfectly brutal. But it is all right now. I am\n" +
                "not sorry for anything that has happened. It has taught me to know\n" +
                "myself better.\"\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"Ah, Dorian, I am so glad you take it in that way! I was afraid I would\n" +
                "find you plunged in remorse, and tearing that nice curly hair of yours.\"\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"I have got through all that,\" said Dorian, shaking his head, and\n" +
                "smiling. \"I am perfectly happy now. I know what conscience is, to begin\n" +
                "with. It is not what you told me it was. It is the divinest thing in us.\n" +
                "Don't sneer at it, Harry, any more--at least not before me. I want to be\n" +
                "good. I can't bear the idea of my soul being hideous.\"\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"A very charming artistic basis for ethics, Dorian! I congratulate you\n" +

                "\n" +
                "\"Marrying Sibyl Vane!\" cried Lord Henry, standing up, and looking at him\n" +
                "in perplexed amazement. \"But, my dear Dorian----\"\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"Yes, Harry, I know what you are going to say. Something dreadful about\n" +
                "marriage. Don't say it. Don't ever say things of that kind to me again.\n" +
                "Two days ago I asked Sibyl to marry me. I am not going to break my word\n" +
                "to her. She is to be my wife!\"\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"Your wife! Dorian!... Didn't you get my letter? I wrote to you this\n" +

                "\n" +
                "\"Your letter? Oh, yes, I remember. I have not read it yet, Harry. I was\n" +
                "afraid there might be something in it that I wouldn't like. You cut life\n" +

                "\n" +
                "Lord Henry walked across the room, and, sitting down by Dorian Gray,\n" +
                "took both his hands in his own, and held them tightly. \"Dorian,\" he\n" +
                "said, \"my letter--don't be frightened--was to tell you that Sibyl Vane\n" +

                "\n" +
                "\"It is quite true, Dorian,\" said Lord Henry, gravely. \"It is in all the\n" +
                "morning papers. I wrote down to you to ask you not to see anyone till I\n" +
                "came. There will have to be an inquest, of course, and you must not be\n" +
                "mixed up in it. Things like that make a man fashionable in Paris. But in\n" +
                "London people are so prejudiced. Here, one should never make one's\n" +
                "_dÃ©but_ with a scandal. One should reserve that to give an interest to\n" +
                "one's old age. I suppose they don't know your name at the theatre? If\n" +
                "they don't, it is all right. Did anyone see you going round to her room?\n" +

                "with her mother, about half-past twelve or so, she said she had\n" +
                "forgotten something upstairs. They waited some time for her, but she did\n" +
                "not come down again. They ultimately found her lying dead on the floor\n" +
                "of her dressing-room. She had swallowed something by mistake, some\n" +
                "dreadful thing they use at theatres. I don't know what it was, but it\n" +
                "had either prussic acid or white lead in it. I should fancy it was\n" +
                "prussic acid, as she seems to have died instantaneously.\"\n" +

                "\"Yes; it is very tragic, of course, but you must not get yourself mixed\n" +

                "thought she was almost younger than that. She looked such a child, and\n" +
                "seemed to know so little about acting. Dorian, you mustn't let this\n" +
                "thing get on your nerves. You must come and dine with me, and afterwards\n" +
                "we will look in at the Opera. It is a Patti night, and everybody will be\n" +

                "then go on to the Opera, and sup somewhere, I suppose, afterwards. How\n" +
                "extraordinarily dramatic life is! If I had read all this in a book,\n" +
                "Harry, I think I would have wept over it. Somehow, now that it has\n" +
                "happened actually, and to me, it seems far too wonderful for tears. Here\n" +
